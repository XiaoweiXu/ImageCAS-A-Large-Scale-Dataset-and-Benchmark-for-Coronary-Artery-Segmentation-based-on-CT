# ImageCAS-A-Large-Scale-Dataset-and-Benchmark-for-Coronary-Artery-Segmentation-based-on-Computed-Tomo

This dataset contains about 1000 3D CTA images, which is considerably larger than the existing public datasets.
On the other hand, we also propose a benchmark based on the proposed dataset, in which we have not only implemented several typical existing methods but also proposed a strong baseline method.

Please send emails to me xiao.wei.xu@foxmail.com for the link and the password to download the dataset.
