# ImageCAS-A-Large-Scale-Dataset-and-Benchmark-for-Coronary-Artery-Segmentation-based-on-Computed-Tomo

This dataset contains about 1000 3D CTA images, which is considerably larger than the existing public datasets.
On the other hand, we also propose a benchmark based on the proposed dataset, in which we have not only implemented several typical existing methods but also proposed a strong baseline method.

Currently, we are still preparing and formatting the data, the code and our manuscript now, and it still need some time to publish the resource.

Please send emails to me xiao.wei.xu@foxmail.com for the link and the password to download the dataset and the benchmark.
